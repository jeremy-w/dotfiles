#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Sync the working-copy skills/ into the installed plugin cache so that
# `claude -p` (used by run-content-evals.sh) loads the EDITED skill, not the
# last published one.
#
# Why this exists:
#   content-evals invoke the skill via Claude Code's plugin mechanism, which
#   reads from ~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/<version>/skills/.
#   Editing skills/ in the repo does NOT change what the eval sees until you
#   copy it into that cache. Skipping this step silently grades the OLD skill —
#   wasting every token spent on the run.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .claude/skills/sync-skill-cache/scripts/sync-cache.sh          # sync + verify
#   bash .claude/skills/sync-skill-cache/scripts/sync-cache.sh --check  # verify only, no copy
